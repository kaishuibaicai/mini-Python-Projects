Gif_Ascii_Animator.py
this is a small project that I made in my free time :-)
This will load a gif, split the gif into seperate images, convert those images into
ascii representations, and then print those ascii representations to the console accompanied
by a background song. It's a fun little script to play around with!
This script will work with any gif or sound clip(within reason) but it
was designed to use the carlton dancing gif to the tune of 'It's not Unusual' by Tom Jones
but for the sake of copyright I'm not going to include either of those files in this project.

#transparent it won't turn out right whenever we weight the ascii characters, so
#in order to render everything in ascii text we can paint the image over a canvas so it
#gets a proper color. however it also looks good without this fill.
